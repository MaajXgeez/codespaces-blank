# 1. Identify 4 different data types and provide a 
# use case/ scenario for when you would use each one.

Certainly! Here are four different data types and their respective use cases/scenarios:

1. **Integer (int):**
   - **Use Case/Scenario:** You would use the integer data type to represent whole numbers in programming. For example, when tracking the quantity of items in a shopping cart, the age of a person, or the number of days in a month, you would use integers.

2. **Floating-Point (float):**
   - **Use Case/Scenario:** Floating-point numbers are used to represent values with a fractional part. For instance, when dealing with measurements like temperature (e.g., 98.6°F), currency (e.g., $19.99), or scientific data (e.g., 3.14159 for π), you would use floating-point data types.

3. **String (str):**
   - **Use Case/Scenario:** Strings are used to store text data. You would use strings to represent names, addresses, messages, and any sequence of characters. For example, when storing a person's name like "John Smith" or a message like "Hello, World!", you would use string data types.

4. **Boolean (bool):**
   - **Use Case/Scenario:** Booleans are used for representing binary values, typically "True" or "False." They are essential for making decisions in conditional statements. For example, when checking if a user is logged in (True) or not (False) to grant access to certain features, you would use boolean data types.

These are just a few examples of data types, and programming languages often have more specialized data types to handle various scenarios and data structures.


# 2. Describe what a variable is and also provide 
# three (3) variable naming rules

**Variable Definition:**
A variable is a symbolic name or identifier used to store and manipulate data within a computer program. It acts as a container or a storage location in the computer's memory where you can store and retrieve values. Variables are fundamental components of programming and are used to store various types of data, such as numbers, text, and complex objects.

**Three Variable Naming Rules:**

1. **Start with a letter or underscore:** Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) character. It should not start with a number (0-9) or any other special character.

2. **Consist of letters, numbers, and underscores:** Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores. They are case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different. For example, "myVariable" and "myvariable" would be treated as distinct variables in most programming languages.

3. **Avoid using reserved words:** Variable names should not be the same as reserved words or keywords in the programming language you are using. Reserved words have special meanings and are used for specific purposes within the language. For example, in Python, you should avoid naming a variable "if," "while," or "class" because these are reserved keywords.

Following these naming rules ensures that your variables are easy to understand and maintain, making your code more readable and less error-prone. Additionally, it's a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful names for your variables to enhance the clarity of your code.

# 4. Create a function that will prompt a user to enter their name and their grade 
# and depending on their grade level will return a custom message. If the user is in 
# grades 9 and 10, The message should be as followed:
# Welcome “student name” to ‘introduction to Python’ class.
# Else if they are in grades 11 or 12, the message should be the following:
# Welcome “student name” to Advance Placement Python’ class

# 5. Write a program that will apply a discount to a person's purchase, 
# only if they are a member of the store’s club. Your function should allow a user to 
# enter a product name and product price. The product price should be entered as a float. 
# Your program should ask the user if they are a member of their stores club. If yes, 
# then apply a 25% discount to their product and return the final price of the item. If no, 
# ask the user if they would like to become a member. If the user enters yes, they will receive a 
# 10% discount on their product. If the user enters no, they do not want to become a member, your program 
# should return the regular price of the item. 

# 6. Create a program that will loop through an array of lists to find all the users who are members of the math club. 
# Use the following array of lists below:

john=['john','10th grade','math club']
jennie=['jennie','11th grade','basketball']
april=['april','12th grade','football']
may= ['may','9th grade','math club']
robert=['robert','11','math club']

students=[john, jennie, april,may, robert]

# 7. Create a program that uses a combination of at least three (3) concepts 
# we've learned about in class.
