What did the Jacquard loom do?
Jacquard loom
This handloom was used for weaving silk at Stonehouse in Lanarkshire in the 19th century. 
It has a Jacquard attachment which allows complex patterns to be woven.
The punch cards used in the Jacquard mechanism laid the foundation for modern computer programming.
    to begin basicly this loom was one of the stepping stone of the  great horizion of coding it was what started it from the begining.

another origin of computing in general is the abacus its like a nuber holder used mostly for the 
counting of cattle it was a wooden grid of 4 rows with beads and you would use it to count 1s on the bottom 10s next 
100s after that and 1000s after that and so fourth .

it also said that machine code had a great affect of the entire coding world saying that 5â€“20 percent of coding tasks can now be automated with the help of AI. T
his has had a significant impact on the labor market, reducing absolute demand for certain positions 
while also increasing demand in new areas such as data science and machine learning.
